# FlashMoE: Fast Distributed MoE in a Single Kernel [NeurIPS'25]
FlashMoE is the first fully fused Distributed MoE system that achieves high tensor core utilization
by eliminating kernel boundaries and enabling fine-grained overlap of communication and computation.
We provide high-performance single- and multi-node EP inference 
and work seamlessly with CUDA graphs. See paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04667).

Distributed Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) is an extremely demanding workload, both compute- and communication-intensive.

This makes DMoE the primary bottleneck in distributed inference and a critical target for optimization.

However, existing implementations leave significant performance untapped.

We identify three key sources of inefficiency:

1. **Exposed communication on the critical path**  
2. **Straggler-induced delays** from load imbalance  
3. **System overheads** from dynamic token routing (e.g., metadata management, inputs preprocessing for compute operators like GroupedGEMM)

As a result, GPUs spend much of the MoE runtime stalled rather than executing useful expert work.

## Our Solution: Complete Kernel Fusion

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osayamenja/FlashMoE/main/assets/FlashMoE_Arch_title.png" width="700" alt="">
<p><em>Figure 3: FlashMoE Architecture</em></p>
</div>

We address these inefficiencies through **complete kernel fusion**, enabling:

1. **Fine-grained overlap of communication and computation** at tile granularity  
2. **Latency hiding of preprocessing and system overheads** via SM specialization  
3. **Exploitation of task locality at scale**, allowing SMs to execute ready tasks out-of-order, minimizing tensor core idle time and boosting SM utilization.

In contrast, existing implementations rely on tens to hundreds of serialized kernels, enforcing strict execution order
and limiting _task locality_.

This results in unnecessary stalls—for example, during collective synchronization (AllGather, ReduceScatter, AllToAll),
where GPUs idle waiting for stragglers instead of executing independent compute tasks.

## Our Work
We present **FlashMoE** (Figure 3), the first **fully fused Distributed MoE system**.

FlashMoE is a high-throughput, portable system that fuses:
- MoE Dispatch  
- Expert Computation (Gated MLP or standard MLP)  
- MoE Combine  

into a **single tile-pipelined persistent kernel**.

At its core, FlashMoE embeds an **Operating System within the kernel**, enabling concurrent scheduling and execution,
thereby hiding system and communication latency. 

FlashMoE is built from the ground up in **CUDA C++**, with selective inline PTX.
It leverages:

- [cuBLASDx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublasdx/) for device-side high-performance compute  
- [NVSHMEM](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvshmem) for asynchronous, device-initiated communication  
- [CCCL](https://github.com/nvidia/cccl) and [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass) for critical infrastructure

### 🏎️ Portability

We support 
- CUDA GPUs and interconnects supported by the upstream FlashMoE dependencies.
- FP16, BF16, FP32 (TF32) and FP64. FP8 and even lower precision types are on the roadmap (we welcome contributions!)

## 🚀 Python QuickStart
```bash
pip install flashmoe-py[cu12] # or cu13
```
## Python API Showcase
See `quickstart.py` for a complete example, the below is just a showcase.
```python
import flashmoe

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # model shape
    # model description which flashmoe.initialize uses to JIT compile the kernel
    tokens_per_rank = ...
    token_dim = ...
    ffn_size = ...
    num_experts = ...
    k = 1
    mlp_type = flashmoe.MLPType.GATED # Gated MLP
    data_type = flashmoe.DataType.BF16
    act_type = flashmoe.ActivationType.SILU
    
    init_args = flashmoe.InitArgs(...)
    
    flash_handle = flashmoe.initialize(init_args)
    router_handle = flashmoe.router.initialize(init_args)

    router_forward_args = ...
    # single kernel for GEMM + Softmax + topk selection
    flashmoe.router.forward(router_handle, flash_handle, router_forward_args)
    
    flashmoe_forward_args = ...
    # single kernel for Dispatch + Experts + Combine
    flashmoe.forward(flash_handle, flashmoe_forward_args)
    
    # call finalize

## Running a Python Program
We suggest running these to verify that you meet all installation requirements.

## Single-Node
### Torchrun

```shell
torchrun --nproc_per_node=<number of GPUs> quickstart.py --torch-init
```

### MPI
```shell
pip install mpi4py
mpirun -n <number of GPUs> python3 quickstart.py
```

### Multi-node
Getting this to work would be dependent on the launcher in your cluster. 
Below, we suggest some launch recipes. Use what works for you.
```shell
# SLURM with libfabric (tested)
export NVSHMEM_REMOTE_TRANSPORT=libfabric
export NVSHMEM_LIBFABRIC_PROVIDER=... # efa,cxi,or verbs
export NVSHMEM_DISABLE_CUDA_VMM=1
export NVSHMEM_BOOTSTRAP=MPI
srun -N <number of nodes> -n <total number of gpus> \
    --ntasks-per-node=<gpus per node> --gpus-per-task=1 --gpu-bind=closest python3 quickstart.py
```
```shell 
# torchrun with Connect-x NICs (not tested)
export NVSHMEM_IB_ENABLE_IBGDA=true
torchrun \
    --nproc_per_node=<number of GPUs> \
    --nnodes<...> \
    --rdzv_endpoint=<master address, like hostname of rank 0> \
    --rdzv_backend=c10d \
    --rdzv-id=<some id, like 123456789> \
    --node_rank=<...> python3 quickstart.py
```

## Use C++ API (header-only)
Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`

)
set(CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "native") # or your own architecture

#...
CPMAddPackage(
